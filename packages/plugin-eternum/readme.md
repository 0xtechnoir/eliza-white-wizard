# Generative Actions

### TODO:

-   Finish the World state. We need to come up with a way to have some common world state. This might be a common query that we fetch. Think of this as like the 'UI' the agent can see. Resources, Number of buildings and location.

-   Complete typedoc implementation within eternum provider. There are already examples

-   Work out way to generate all constants into a nice single string and inject into the game guide prompts.

-   Complete game guide of familar things the agent should know. Steps for building a building, trading steps etc
